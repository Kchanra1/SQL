# For this project, I downloaded a Spotify dataset from Kaggle to perform data analytics using SQL.


#Creating the Spotify Data table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.SpotifyData (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Next, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Then, I explored the data by using the following SQL: 

-- What is the average danceability by artist?
SELECT AVG(danceability), artist_name
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY AVG(danceability) DESC;

-- Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceabilIty)
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
WHERE popularity IN 

(SELECT popularity
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC 
LIMIT 10);

-- What songs (include artist) have a popularity greater than or equal to 87 and danceability is over 0.6?
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 87 AND danceability > 0.6;


-- How many songs does Ariana Grande have in the top 50 data? 
SELECT COUNT(track_name)
FROM bit_db.spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Ariana Grande';


-- Whose song has the most energy and what is the song title?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(energy)
FROM bit_db.spotifydata;

-- Create a CTE for the following:
#Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the table. 
#Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, you need to show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT spot.artist_name,
AVG(spot.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData spot 
GROUP BY spot.artist_name
)
 
SELECT  artist_name,
        average_popularity,
        'Top Star' AS tag
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
